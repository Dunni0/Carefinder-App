# AltSchool Frontend Capstone Project

Hi There! üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è \
This is my capstone project submission - Carefinder app.
Carefinder allows users to search for hospitals within their region. Users can input their location or select from a list of nearby cities to find hospitals in their area. The platform will provide a list of hospitals and their respective contact details, including address, phone number, and email.
